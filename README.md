# TunnelBlick manipulation applescript

Since tunnelblick is GUI-based app which is painful for terminal lovers, I made an easy script to control the VPN gate (to turn on/off) with command line operation.

## installation

First, please edfit the Line 6 of scripts/tbopen and fill in the configuration name of your VPN config.
Then, 

```
$ ./script/installer
```

## usage
To open the VPN Gate, 

```
$ tbopen
```


To close the VPN Gate, 

```
$ tbopen
```
